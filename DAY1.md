# Questions/Thoughts that comes to mind

- What is the best way to organize css in Vue.js SPA project?
- Is there a centralized state object shared or are the states held per component ViewModel?  -> need to see more examples SPA built with SPA
    - official guid on how to build large scale app ( v1 though ) https://v1.vuejs.org/guide/application.html
- First time using eslint where it is a dependency on build process; indent errors preventing build 


# Long term goals ( so that I do not forget )

- Set up deployment to ( heroku/github or anywhere that can be publically accessed )
